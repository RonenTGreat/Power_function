**Task:**

Given a positive real number a and a non-negative integer n without using loops, ** operator, or the built-in function 
math.pow(). Instead use recursion and the relation a^n  = a * a^(n-1).

a) Write this function and name it, power(a, n)

b) Write unit tests using pytest which test your power function. You should ensure that you include boundary tests in 
your set of tests.
